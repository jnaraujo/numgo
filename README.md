# NumGo

This repository contains a implementation of the Python library [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  written from scratch in Go. The implementation was based on the library's [source code](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and the article by [Tomas Beuzen about Numpy](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/chapters/chapter6-numpy-addendum.html).
